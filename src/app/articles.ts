      title: "NASA Confirms Evidence That Liquid Water Flows on Today's Mars",

      content: `New findings from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) provide the strongest evidence yet that liquid water flows intermittently on present-day Mars.
      Using an MRO imaging spectrometer, researchers detected signatures of hydrated minerals on slopes where mysterious streaks were seen on the Red Planet. These darkish streaks appear to ebb and flow over time. They darken and appear to flow down steep slopes during warm seasons, and then fade into cooler seasons. They appear in several locations on Mars when temperatures are above minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 Celsius), and disappear at colder times.`

      title: "Starship and Super Heavy: SpaceX's Mars-Colonizing Transportation System",

      content: `Starship and Super Heavy are the biggest, most important pieces of Elon Musk's grand plan for SpaceX, his private spaceflight company.
      Musk has repeatedly stressed that he founded SpaceX back in 2002 primarily to help humanity colonize Mars. It's vital that we become a multiplanet species, the billionaire entrepreneur has said, citing both a  much-reduced probability of extinction and the thrill that meaningful space exploration will deliver to billions of people around the world.
      SpaceX is now actively trying to turn this sci-fi dream into reality. The company is developing a 100-passenger spaceship called Starship and a giant rocket known as Super Heavy, which together constitute the transportation system that Musk thinks will bring Mars settlement within reach at long last.
      "This is the fastest path to a self-sustaining city on Mars," Musk said in September 2019, during a webcast update about the Starship-Super Heavy architecture.`

      title: "The Mars Opportunity rover, built to last 90 days, has ended its mission after 15 years on the red planet",
      author: 'NASA 13.02.2019',
      image: 'img3.jpg',
      content: `On Tuesday (February 13, 2019) NASA announced that its Mars Opportunity rover mission – one of the most successful and enduring feats of interplanetary exploration – was at an end after almost 15 years exploring the surface of Mars.
      The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June 2018. After more than a thousand commands to restore contact, engineers in the Space Flight Operations Facility at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made their last attempt to revive Opportunity on Tuesday, to no avail. The solar-powered rover’s final communication was received June 10, 2018.`
